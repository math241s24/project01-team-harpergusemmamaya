# Proposal

Your proposal should include:

-   A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)
-   The reason why you chose this dataset.
-   The two questions you want to answer.
    -   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
    
```{r}
library(readr)
bob_ross <- 
```
    
-   We chose to use this dataset because we're fans of Bob Ross and curious about how systematic he may or may not be in his color use across seasons.
-   The two questions we want to answer are:
    1.  How does bob Ross's color use change across time? Which colors are most popular in each season?
    2.  Which seasons have the most diverse color palettes? Which seasons have the most abundant color palettes?
-   Our plans to answer each question are:
    1.  Make a new variable combining season and episode using the mutate function. Make density plots/barplot for each color using that new time variable as the x-axis.
    2.  Use the summarize function to count the average number of colors in each season, then use Simpson's diversity index to measure how diverse the color palettes are:
        -   Diversity = 1 - sum(n(n-1)/N(N-1)), where: - n = \# times a color is used - N = \# times any color is used
