## Bob Ross!

![](/_site/Analysis_files/figure-html/Bob_at_Easel.jpeg)

## Introduction

-   Our project is based on the Bob Ross dataset!
    -   Catalogs the colors used in each painting across all 31 seasons 
-   We will be using this data to investigate two questions: 
    1.    How does Bob Ross's color use change across time? Which colors are most popular in each season?
    2.    Which seasons have the most diverse color palettes? Which seasons have the most abundant color palettes?
