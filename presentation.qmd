## Outline

-   Your presentation should generally follow the same structure as your write-up.

-   Each team will have 5 minutes for their presentation, and each team member must speak (roughly equally) during this time.

-   Your presentation will be created using `Quarto`, which allows you to write slides using the same coding structure you’re used to with `Rmarkdown`.

-   This is a sample Quarto slide template you can edit to your desire to create your presentation.

## Rubric

-   Roughly I recommend 1 slide for introduction, 2 slides for Question 1, ans 2 slides for Question 2.
    -   You can imagine spending roughly one minute on each slide.
    -   You should feel free to have more (or fewer) slides.
-   Your evaluation will be based on your content, professionalism (including sticking to time), and your performance during the Q&A (question and answer). We don’t care how many slides you use to do this.

## Introduction

-   Our project is based on the Bob Ross dataset!
    -   Catalogs the colors used in each painting across all 31 seasons 
-   We will be using this data to investigate two questions: 
    1.    How does Bob Ross's color use change across time? Which colors are most popular in each season?
    2.    Which seasons have the most diverse color palettes? Which seasons have the most abundant color palettes?
